# Digitization Projects

This repository links to a selection of successful student digitization projects that were submitted for a course called *Digitizing Cultural Heritage Material* taught in the MA Programmes DLIS (Digital Library and Information Services) and MADI (Masterprogram i Biblioteks- och informationsvetenskap, distansutbildning) at the [University of Bor√•s](https://hb.se), Sweden. 

For this assignment, students perform a small-scale digitization project of documents of their own choosing, and reflect on the way in which the equipment they have at their disposal, the methods they use, and the decisions they make along the way affect the accessibility and long-term sustainability of their digitization efforts. 

These projects are all hosted on GitHub using GitHub Pages, and as such made publicly available by the students. The students and their work are only referenced here by means of their GiHub accounts, repositories, and site deployments. When we notice that students have taken down their repositories and/or site deployments, they will be removed from this list. 

## Materials

Students have learned to work with GitHub by using our [pizzaParty](https://github.com/SSLIS/pizzaParty) repository (which includes a link to an instructive video lecture and a GitHub Wiki). In most cases, they have started their work from our [Template](https://github.com/SSLIS/DCHM-template).
